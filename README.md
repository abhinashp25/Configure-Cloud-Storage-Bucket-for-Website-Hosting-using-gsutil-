Configure Cloud Storage Bucket for Website Hosting using gsutil
Overview

This project shows how to configure an existing Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket to host a static website using the gsutil command-line tool.

The script not only enables website hosting but also includes basic error handling to make sure problems (like a missing bucket or permission issues) are clearly reported.
